Celestial Body Simulation

A simulation done with python pygame. The program simulates three celestial bodies in space. The purpose of the program was for me to learn about perspective, vectors, matrix calculations such as rotations. The main challenge was in creating a movable camera and projecting from 3d to 2d.

Dependencies

pygame,numpy

To install the dependencies, use pip:

pip install pygame numpy


Running the Program

To run the program, simply execute it:

python main.py

Use mousedrag to rotate camera and mousewheel to move the camera. Esc is a pause button and will show other options such as reset system, randomize system, do blackhole system, hide instructions and switch between weighted and non weighted geometric center.
Known Limitations


There are a number of things marked as #TODO in the code. Some perspective stuff still needs work.
